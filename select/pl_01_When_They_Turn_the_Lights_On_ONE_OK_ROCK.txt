I BEEN CLIMBING SINCE I WAS YOUNG
NEVER STOPPED TO LOOK DOWN
I LOST TRACK OF THE MAN I WAS
TOOK A FALL TO KNOW HOW
SELFISH I'VE BEEN
OH, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE
TO LOSE IT ALL
AND FIND MYSELF
I WAS BROKEN I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT
I KNOW THAT I WAS WRONG
BUT WHEN THEY TURN THE LIGHTS ON
I'LL BE STRONGER I CAN STAND A LITTLE TALLER
THE DARKNESS WILL BE GONE
WHEN THEY TURN THE LIGHTS ON
LIGHTS ON TONIGHT
I WENT SWIMMING WITH HEAVY WEIGHTS
I WAS HOLDING HY BREATH
I BEEN DROWNING IN MY MISTAKES
IN A SEA OF REGRETS
SELFISH I BEEN
OH, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE
TO LOSE IT ALL
AND FIND MYSELF
I WAS BROKEN I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT
I KNOW THAT I WAS WRONG
BUT WHEN THEY TURN THE LIGHTS ON
I'LL BE STRONGER I CAN STAND A LITTLE TALLER
THE DARKNESS WILL BE GONE
WHEN THEY TURN THE LIGHTS ON
LIGHTS ON TONIGHT
NEEDED SOME REFLECTION IN MY LIFE
NEVER SEEN A VISION QUITE AS BRIGHT
I JUST WANT A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE IT BETTER,
BETTER
IT'S NEVER ENOUGH
I WAS BROKEN I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT
I KNOW THAT I WAS WRONG
BUT WHEN THEY TURN THE LIGHTS ON
I'LL BE STRONGER I CAN STAND A LITTLE TALLER
THE DARKNESS WILL BE GONE
WHEN THEY TURN THE LIGHTS ON
光が暗闇を照らしていく
もう恐れるものはない
